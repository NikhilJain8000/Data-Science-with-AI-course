        "1. **Abstract Class (`Shape`)**  \n",
        "   - Defines an abstract method `area()` that all subclasses must implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Concrete Classes (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`)**  \n",
        "   - Each subclass implements the `area()` method in its own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphic Function (`print_area(shape)`)**  \n",
        "   - Accepts any `Shape` object and calls its `area()` method without knowing its specific type.\n",
        "   - Works seamlessly with different shape objects, demonstrating **runtime polymorphism**.\n",

        "### **Why Use Polymorphism?**\n",
        "✅ **Code Reusability:** One function handles multiple types.  \n",
        "✅ **Flexibility:** Easily add new shapes without modifying the function.  \n",
        "✅ **Encapsulation:** Hides implementation details of each shape.  \n",
